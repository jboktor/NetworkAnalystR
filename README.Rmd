The goal of NetworkAnalystR is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of NetworkAnalystR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("xia-lab/NetworkAnalystR")
```

## Example Data

Importing example data:

```{r example, eval=F}
# Create objects for storing processed data
nSet <- Init.Data()

# Read in the data and fill in the dataSet list 
nSet <- ReadTabExpressData("data/test/estrogen.txt")

# Perform data annotation
nSet <- PerformDataAnnot("hsa", "array", "hgu95av2", "mean")

```


## README.Rmd

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.
